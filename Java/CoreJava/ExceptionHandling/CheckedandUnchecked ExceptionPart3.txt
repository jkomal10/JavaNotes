Checked and Unchecked Exception

-Exceptions are occured at run time only
-Exceptions which are checked by compiler for smooth excution of program at run time these exceptions are called checked exception
ex-
class test
{
psvmain(String[] args)
{
printWriter pw=new PrintWriter("file.txt");
pw.println("hello");
}
}

CheckedException:-unreported exception java.io.FIlenotfoundExceptoin;
must be caught or declare to be thrown

if there is chance of exception occur we should handle it by try-catch or by using throws keyword otherwise code will not run/excute

Checked exception VS unchecked Exception
-The exceptions which are checked by compiler for smooth execution of program at run time are called checked exceptoins
ex-FileNotFoundExceptoin

-Exceptions which are not checked by compiler whether programmer handling or not are called unchecked exception.
ex-ArithmeticException
-NullPointerException
