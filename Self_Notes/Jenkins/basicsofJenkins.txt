Jenkins-
open source---written in java---continouos integration tool with plugins. Plugins allows integration of various devOps stages.
it is an java application-PLATFORM INDEPENDENT
-used for continouos integration and continuous delivery
-as developer check in their code to shared repository (git, bigbucket) and if eod we integrate whole code and bulid it, it will give error but if if we use jenkins then as we send code to shared repository it will it will pass to jenkins , jenkin build it , perform some testing on it and then give success or failure result to the developer.

how does jenkins works
-developer no need to wait for result
-build-test-deploy
-since after every commit to the source code an auto build is triggered and then it is automatically depolyed on the test server
-if the test results shows that there is a bug in the code then the developers only have to check the last commit made to the source code
-this also increase the frequency of new software release
-the concerned teams are always provided with the relevant feedback
-continouos integration-frequent commit it will build every commit and deploy it on test server
