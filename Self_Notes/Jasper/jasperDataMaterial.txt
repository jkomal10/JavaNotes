JasperReports Server is a component of both a community project and commercial offerings. Each integrates the standard features such as security, scheduling, a web services interface, and much more for running and sharing reports. Commercial editions provide additional features, including Ad Hoc views and reports, advanced charts, dashboards, Domains, auditing, and a multi-organization architecture for hosting large BI deployments.
