Hashmap internally create array of buckets.
 array contains 16 buckets. (0-15)
 Each bucket is node or linked list .
 Map<String,integer> map=new Hashmap<>();
 ex-to inserrt values into hashmapmap
 map.put("abc_key",10);
 put(key k,value v)
 it will calculate hashcode of key
 hashcode=hash(key);/////111112
 -hashcode is used to retrieve value from bucket and to store values into index.it works fast
 -index=hash&(n-1) //it will return index
 so if index is 4 then node is created at index 4 which contains key , value,hashcode and next (next contains address of next node)
 -111112/abc/10/next    node contain this data
 -if we put key as null it will goes into zeroth index or bucket
 map.put("null",4);
